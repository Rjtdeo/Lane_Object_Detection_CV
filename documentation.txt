=============

1. Overview
-----------
This project combines two parts: lane detection and object detection.  
Both parts run together in one Python script that processes driving images and
creates an output video. The video shows lane lines, object boxes, and FPS
information on every frame.

2. Lane Detection
-----------------
The lane detection part uses basic computer vision steps:

- Convert the frame to grayscale
- Focus only on the bottom part of the image (Region of Interest)
- Use Canny edge detection to find edges
- Use Hough Transform to find straight lane lines
- Draw those lane lines on the frame

This creates a simple visual overlay that highlights the left and right lane
boundaries.

3. Object Detection
-------------------
For object detection, I trained a YOLOv8n model. The training data came from
nuScenes camera images, which were auto-labeled using YOLOv8x.

The model can detect:
- Cars
- Buses
- Trucks
- Motorcycles
- Pedestrians
- Traffic lights

During inference, the script draws green bounding boxes with class labels and
confidence values.

4. Multi-Camera Input
---------------------
The project uses images from all six nuScenes cameras:

CAM_FRONT  
CAM_FRONT_LEFT  
CAM_FRONT_RIGHT  
CAM_BACK  
CAM_BACK_LEFT  
CAM_BACK_RIGHT  

All images are loaded, sorted, and processed one after another so the final
video looks smooth and continuous.

5. Final Output
---------------
When the script runs, it:

- Performs lane detection
- Performs YOLO object detection
- Combines both overlays
- Writes out an annotated MP4 video
- Saves a few sample frames inside the results folder

This makes it easy to show how the system works.

6. Requirements
---------------
The project needs these Python libraries:

- ultralytics
- opencv-python
- numpy
- torch
- tqdm

They can be installed using: pip install ultralytics opencv-python numpy torch tqdm

7. Notes
--------
- The lane detection and object detection run separately but are combined in the
  final image.
- Training the model is optional because a best.pt file is already available.
- The script will automatically use a GPU if the system has one.
