Week 5 Log 

This week I completed the full inference pipeline and produced the final annotated video.

Key tasks completed:
- Combined all camera images into a multi-camera sequence.
- Added per-frame FPS calculation.
- Wrote the final video output using OpenCV VideoWriter.
- Saved sample frames for documentation.
- Finalized README, documentation, and reproducibility files.
- Prepared video demo for submission.
