Week 4 Log 

The focus this week was integrating lane detection with object detection.

Key tasks completed:
- Implemented lane detection using grayscale conversion, ROI masking, Canny edges, 
  and Hough line detection.
- Developed an overlay function to draw detected lanes.
- Combined lane overlay with YOLO detections to create a unified annotated frame.
- Began writing the multi-camera pipeline to process all nuScenes camera folders.
